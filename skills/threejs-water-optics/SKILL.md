# Water Optics

Select the least complex water representation that owns the requested
observable, then derive displacement, derivatives, foam, wetness, and optical
transport from that state.

## 1. Gate the water model

| Required observable | Representation | Invalid when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Static surface and bathymetry; only bottom visibility, refraction, attenuation, or caustics matter | Static bathymetry plus optical transport | Surface motion, waterline motion, or interaction is required |
| Prescribed coast-following crests; no flow or interaction claim | Coast SDF plus prescribed shoreline phase | Diffraction, run-up, bulk flow, or changing wet/dry topology matters |
| Few coherent waves; no local disturbance | Parametric displaced surface | Broad stochastic bands or dense interaction dominate |
| Bounded weak waves and local impulses | Linear heightfield | Breaking, bulk flow, or wet/dry topology matters |
| Fixed bathymetry; phase-averaged shoaling/refraction | Wave action or rays | Diffraction, interference, or instantaneous crest parity matters |
| Fixed bathymetry; linear diffraction/interference | Frequency-domain mild slope | Breaking, run-up, moving bed, or live broad spectra matter |
| Long waves over permanently wet variable depth | Linear elevation/discharge shallow water | Wet/dry fronts, bores, or finite-amplitude flow matter |
| Run-up, bores, depth-averaged wakes, or changing wet topology | Positivity-preserving nonlinear shallow water | Dispersive or three-dimensional breaking is required |
| Overturning, entrained air, jets, or three-dimensional vortices | External free-surface/particle/VOF solver | A single-valued or depth-averaged model is sufficient |
| Body motion affects water and water reaction affects the body | Selected water solver plus the two-way coupling branch | One-way visual following or a prescribed wake is sufficient |

Route broad homogeneous wind sea or swell to `$threejs-spectral-ocean`. Normal-
only detail is a display optimization, not another physical owner.

Record domain size, smallest resolved wavelength, interaction radius,
bathymetric variation, phase/error tolerance, conservation needs, wet/dry
topology, and sustained budget. Hybridize only across an explicit spatial or
frequency handoff.

**Complete when:** every required observable has exactly one valid owner and
every rejected representation has a stated validity or measured cost reason.

## 2. Freeze coordinates, state, and ownership

Use metres and seconds in a stable physics frame:

```text
z_b(x,z) = upward-positive bed elevation
eta(x,z,t) = free-surface elevation
h = max(eta-z_b,0)

phi > 0 on land
phi = 0 at the authored still-water coast
phi < 0 in water.
```

Declare the water datum, gravity, bed and coast-distance sources, valid mask,
cell footprint, reconstruction/filter, boundary labels, obstacle representation,
current, and clock. Horizontal coast distance is not vertical water depth.

Assign exactly one owner to water state, geometry, offshore forcing, foam,
exposed-bed wetness, caustics, opaque refraction inputs, and final output.
Every boundary is periodic, reflecting/wall, absorbing/radiation, prescribed
inflow, or outflow with a named mathematical treatment.

For each water boundary, declare producer, consumer, and state owner; units and
stable physics frame/origin; sample instant or application interval, clock,
cadence, and sample phase; support/filter; validity, staleness, and error; and
state/resource versions. Distinguish rates from interval-integrated mass,
momentum, or energy. Name forcing, reaction, geometry, and presentation
ownership and their order. A clock discontinuity, rebase, representation or
owner change, or incompatible version resets every dependent solver, foam,
wetness, query, and temporal state. Invoke `$threejs-choose-skills` when a
multi-system route still needs ownership selection.

**Complete when:** bed, coast, datum, state, boundary, clock, and output
ownership agree at every sample; the SDF zero contour and `z_b=eta_0` contour
meet their declared gate.

## 3. Implement the selected branch

Read only the linked heading span: start at the heading and stop before the next
heading at the same or higher level.

| Selected representation | Required reference spans |
| --- | --- |
| Static surface and bathymetry | [Domain data and invariants](references/coastal-water-system.md#domain-data-and-invariants), then the required optical spans below |
| Parametric displaced surface | [Exact parametric waves](references/water-surface-system.md#exact-parametric-waves) and [Physics-horizontal queries](references/water-surface-system.md#physics-horizontal-queries) |
| Bounded linear heightfield | [Bounded linear heightfield](references/water-surface-system.md#bounded-linear-heightfield) |
| Prescribed coast-following phase | [Domain data and invariants](references/coastal-water-system.md#domain-data-and-invariants) and [Prescribed shoreline phase](references/coastal-water-system.md#prescribed-shoreline-phase) |
| Wave action or rays | [Domain data and invariants](references/coastal-water-system.md#domain-data-and-invariants) and [Depth-aware wave action and rays](references/coastal-water-system.md#depth-aware-wave-action-and-rays) |
| Frequency-domain mild slope | [Domain data and invariants](references/coastal-water-system.md#domain-data-and-invariants) and [Mild-slope branch](references/coastal-water-system.md#mild-slope-branch) |
| Fixed-wet linear shallow water | [Domain data and invariants](references/coastal-water-system.md#domain-data-and-invariants) and [Fixed-wet linear shallow water](references/coastal-water-system.md#fixed-wet-linear-shallow-water) |
| Nonlinear wet/dry shallow water | [Domain data and invariants](references/coastal-water-system.md#domain-data-and-invariants) and [Nonlinear shallow water with wet/dry fronts](references/coastal-water-system.md#nonlinear-shallow-water-with-wetdry-fronts) |
| External solver | Use the [External solver](#external-solver) adapter contract below; load only shared spans needed by its published channels |

Load these additional spans only when the named concern is selected:

- offshore coupling: [Offshore/nearshore handoff](references/coastal-water-system.md#offshorenearshore-handoff);
- breaking, foam, or exposed-bed wetness: [Breaking, foam, and wetness](references/coastal-water-system.md#breaking-foam-and-wetness);
- sparse execution: [Sparse active tiles](references/coastal-water-system.md#sparse-active-tiles);
- live-grid CPU queries: [Live GPU-grid query contract](references/water-surface-system.md#live-gpu-grid-query-contract);
- receiver caustics: [Receiver-space caustics](references/water-surface-system.md#receiver-space-caustics);
- refraction or interface reflection: [Refraction and Fresnel](references/water-surface-system.md#refraction-and-fresnel);
- absorption or scattering: [Beer-Lambert transport](references/water-surface-system.md#beer-lambert-transport);
- coastal optical/lifecycle integration: [Optics and presentation](references/coastal-water-system.md#optics-and-presentation);
- GPU implementation: [WebGPU implementation](references/water-surface-system.md#webgpu-implementation).

After a surface/optics branch, apply the matching bullets in
[surface acceptance](references/water-surface-system.md#acceptance). After a
coastal branch, apply the matching bullets in
[coastal acceptance](references/coastal-water-system.md#acceptance).

### Parametric surface

Evaluate one displacement map, both analytic tangents, the horizontal
Jacobian, and the upward cross-product normal. Physics-horizontal queries invert
the horizontal map.

**Branch complete when:** parameter and physics-horizontal samples have
unambiguous semantics; analytic tangents/normals match finite differences; the
minimum Jacobian is positive or every fold is classified invalid; and query
residuals meet their gate.

### Bounded linear heightfield

Use ping-ponged height/vertical-velocity state, fixed `dt`, dimensioned
sources, an explicit boundary condition, and this dispatch order:

```text
event gather -> propagate -> swap -> derivatives -> optical auxiliaries.
```

**Branch complete when:** the CFL margin is positive; analytic-mode phase and
amplitude errors, boundary reflection, mean drift, precision error, and
finite-value scan pass; overlapping events have no write race; and every
consumer reads derivatives from the new state.

### Prescribed coast-following phase

Derive crest phase from coast distance or a converged eikonal travel-time field.
The phase branch owns crest placement and a prescribed wash mask only; it makes
no flow, momentum, or wave-energy claim.

**Branch complete when:** crest direction, spacing, and speed; coastwise
continuity; eikonal residual and unreachable classification; medial-axis coast
ownership; and fragment-footprint filtering all pass their gates, with the
no-flow/no-energy claim explicit.

### Wave action or rays

Transport dimensioned action/energy by frequency and direction. Keep current,
intrinsic frequency, group velocity, quadrature, dissipation, and a separately
owned display phase explicit. Rays make no diffraction/interference claim.

**Branch complete when:** dispersion/group velocity, phase-loop or curl,
action/energy balance, shoaling/refraction, regularization, and handoff
reflection pass over the represented band.

### Mild slope

Solve complex phase/amplitude for fixed, slowly varying bathymetry with
radiation/open boundaries. Prefer an offline solution when sources and
bathymetry are stationary.

**Branch complete when:** manufactured or independent-reference convergence,
phase/amplitude interpolation, boundary reflection, and stored-field
invalidation pass.

### Fixed-wet linear shallow water

Evolve surface perturbation and depth-integrated discharge with compatible
discrete divergence/gradient or one finite-volume flux.

**Branch complete when:** permanently wet state is enforced; mass and declared
energy behavior close; dispersion and boundary reflection pass; and no
wet/dry, bore, or finite-amplitude claim is made.

### Nonlinear wet/dry shallow water

Evolve conservative depth and momentum with one canonical face flux,
well-balanced bathymetry, positivity-preserving update, dry-cell division
policy, fixed stable step, and conservative source accounting.

**Branch complete when:** depth stays nonnegative without unreported clamping;
lake at rest remains stationary; mass closes against boundary/source fluxes;
dry cells stay finite; shoreline/run-up and grid/timestep/dry-threshold
convergence pass; and boundary reflection is within gate.

### External solver

Consume its versioned surface, velocity, wet/dry, material, and presentation
state through an explicit adapter. Keep external process/queue/fence latency
and unavailable channels visible.

**Branch complete when:** units, frame, clock, interpolation, error, lifecycle,
failure/recovery, and presentation ownership are proven; the render frame does
not synchronously read back or advance the external solve.

### Two-way body coupling

When body motion must affect water and water must react on the body, use one
declared coupling interval:

```text
predict body state
-> sample the same previous/current water bracket at body support points
-> scatter displacement or impulse to water conservatively
-> advance water once
-> reduce reaction force, torque, and interface work over the same support
-> correct body state
-> commit both versions together.
```

Use one physics frame, units, sample identity, and support/Jacobian convention.
Keep collision and render LOD out of the coupling support. Classify the method
as explicit loose coupling or bounded residual iteration; strong added-mass or
stiff feedback requires the iterative branch or an external coupled solver.

**Branch complete when:** equal-and-opposite impulse, force, torque, displaced
volume, and interface-work residuals meet their gates; stationary buoyancy,
translation/rotation, grid/timestep, and iteration controls converge; and no
render-frame readback advances or corrects either state.

## 4. Derive shared surface state once

Geometry, tangents, normal, velocity, shadows, foam source, refraction, and
temporal consumers derive from the selected state version. A handoff has one
geometry owner at every location. Coherent surfaces use matched amplitude and
differentiate the blend, including weight gradients; power windows apply only
to independent or orthogonal bands.

Build one foam source from the strongest represented cause: modeled breaking
loss, calibrated shock/entropy loss, exact compression/Jacobian, or prescribed
crest arrival. Store either transported coverage or conserved areal density
and use its matching equation. One dissipation partition drives one history.

Exactly one exposed-bed receiver owns wetness. Inundation or a declared
prescribed wash mask sets it wet; drying is timestep-correct. Wetness changes
receiver material response, not water mass or shoreline geometry.

For sparse coastal execution, activate from causal influence and interaction
support rather than visibility alone. Fill halos and boundaries before
whole-tile stencils; preserve one face flux across neighbors; account for
activation/deactivation state and error.

**Complete when:** one state version explains every geometric and optical
consumer, foam and wetness each have one owner and reset rule, sparse inactive
regions have an explicit model, and no displayed seam has two surfaces.

## 5. Evaluate optical transport

The opaque color/depth input excludes water. Reconstruct and validate the
refracted ray before using its length. Classify the incident side, use exact
dielectric Fresnel near total internal reflection, and apply Beer-Lambert
extinction in metres:

```text
sigma_t = sigma_a + sigma_s
T = exp(-sigma_t pathLengthMeters)

L_water = F L_reflection
        + (1-F) [T L_background + (1-T) omega_0 L_source].
```

Foam replaces a bounded fraction of this response. A specular BRDF owns sun
glint unless another explicitly budgeted lobe replaces it.

Caustics deposit surface-cell power in receiver space using the determinant of
the receiver map. Track invalid/TIR samples, power before and after deposition,
regularization, filtering, and clamp.

**Complete when:** Fresnel/TIR classification, refracted-ray residual,
path-length validity, absorption/scattering partition, caustic receiver
placement, energy ledger, and final/no-optics/no-caustics/no-foam views pass.

## 6. Integrate GPU state and lifecycle

Run `await renderer.init()` and require
`renderer.backend.isWebGPUBackend === true` before allocating or submitting
compute/storage work. Simulation textures use `NoColorSpace`, explicit
precision, no generated mips, and integer loads for stencils. Each whole-grid
producer/consumer dependency crosses a dispatch boundary.
`renderer.computeAsync(...)` is initialization-safe; its resolved promise is
not GPU-completion evidence. Keep simulation resolution independent of
viewport resolution.

Render with one scene pass, one `RenderPipeline`, and one output transform. If
`renderOutput(...)` owns conversion, set
`pipeline.outputColorTransform = false`. After replacing
`pipeline.outputNode`, set `pipeline.needsUpdate = true`.
Presentation consumes immutable previous/current state with stable identity.
Resize, representation, cadence, active-domain, datum, origin, source, and
solver-version changes migrate compatible state or reset every dependent
history. Dispose resources and listeners with their owner.

**Complete when:** the initialized native-WebGPU backend/capabilities, dispatch
and allocation inventory, peak live bytes, precision comparison, warm sustained
timings, and rebuild/dispose plateau are recorded; no frame-critical readback
or double output transform remains.

## 7. Final falsification

Inspect the applicable diagnostics, not only the final image:

- bathymetry, coast distance/frame, wet mask, boundaries, state, derivatives;
- phase/action/discharge, energy or mass residuals, reflection, wet/dry state;
- foam source/transport/reaction and wetness history;
- refraction validity, Fresnel/TIR, extinction terms, caustic deposition;
- final and disabled-effect captures at fixed cameras and multiple times.

**Complete when:** every selected branch criterion passes, every omitted
phenomenon is outside the claim, every handoff has one producer and consumer,
every resource has an owner and reset/dispose rule, and one causal water state
reaches one final output transform.
